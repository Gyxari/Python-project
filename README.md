# Python web application project

## Jesse Kykyri - Software dev

Hi! In this document I'm going to explain what this project entails. I am a software engineer from Finland, learning to code my way into worklife. I started coding just a couple of years ago at my university of applied sciences, and I have been enjoying programming and bug fixing throughout my school years. 

This project is my re-entering into python and using it to make myself a web application. The usage is a bit unknown right now, as I am dabbling my way through and finding what excites me most about this project.
